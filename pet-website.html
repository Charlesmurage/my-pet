        <h1> My Pet</h1>
        <p> Having a pet is tons of fun, but it’s also a lot of work. From regular exercise to a healthy diet, regular vet visits, training, and more, there are a lot of things to consider – and always something new to learn throughout your journey as a pet parent. But for my pet, it has 
            only 2 favorite toys, a ball and my niece's dolls. But as much as it has two favorite toys, it rarely plays with them because its quite lazy.</p>
